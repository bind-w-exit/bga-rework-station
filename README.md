# BGA Rework Station

This repository contains the firmware and necessary documentation for a BGA (Ball Grid Array) rework station based on the ESP32-C3 microcontroller. The rework station utilizes a WG12864B (ST7920) LCD Display for user interface and a MAX6675 Type-K Thermocouple Amplifier for temperature sensing.

## Features

- Precise temperature control for BGA rework operations.
- User-friendly interface displayed on the WG12864B LCD.
- Real-time temperature monitoring with MAX6675 Type-K Thermocouple Amplifier.
- Adjustable temperature settings for different soldering needs.
